## Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Completed)

This initial phase focused on building a solid foundation with a modern technology stack. All objectives in this phase have been successfully met.

### Key Achievements:

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Frontend:** React with Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.
    *   **Backend:** Supabase (BaaS) for database, authentication, and real-time functionalities.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling workflow.
    *   **UI Components:** Radix UI for accessible and unstyled components.

*   **Database and CRUD Functionality:**
    *   **Supabase Setup:** Configured and connected the Supabase client to the application.
    *   **Database Schema:** Created tables for key modules, including `events`, `testimonies`, and `blog_posts`.
    *   **Full-Stack CRUD:** Implemented full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for all main modules.

*   **Authentication and Security:**
    *   **User Authentication:** Integrated Supabase Auth for user registration, login, and session management.
    *   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Implemented RLS policies in Supabase to ensure that users can only access and modify their own data.
    *   **Protected Routes:** Created protected routes that require authentication to access certain parts of the application.

*   **UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   **Component Library:** Developed a set of reusable and accessible UI components using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Consistent Design:** Applied a consistent design system across the application, following the brand's color palette and style guide.
    *   **Improved User Experience:** Enhanced the overall user experience with a more intuitive and responsive interface.

## Phase 2: Headless CMS Integration (In Progress)

To empower the content team and streamline content management, we are integrating a headless CMS. This will allow for easy updates to the website's content without requiring developer intervention.

### Selected CMS: Strapi

*   **Strapi** has been chosen as our headless CMS due to its flexibility, ease of use, and powerful content modeling features.

### Current Task:

*   **Setup and Configuration:**
    *   Install and configure a new Strapi project.
    *   Define the necessary Content Types (e.g., `articles`, `pages`, `events`).
    *   Configure roles and permissions for content editors.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Pending)

This phase will focus on adding advanced features to enhance user engagement and provide more value to the community.

### Pending Tasks:

*   **E-commerce for "Tienda":**
    *   Integrate a shopping cart and checkout system (e.g., with Stripe or Snipcart).
    *   Develop a product management interface in Strapi.
*   **E-learning for "Escuela de Teolog√≠a":**
    *   Develop a simple Learning Management System (LMS) to manage courses, lessons, and student progress.
